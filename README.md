# Introduction
CAWeb Publishing is the only service to offer the latest California State Website Template on WordPress with full setup and customer support. The best way to use this theme is by subscribing to the [CAWeb Publishing Service](https://cdt.ca.gov/services/caweb-publishing/). If you don't want to use the CAWeb Publishing Service you can still use the CAWeb WordPress theme by purchasing and configuring WordPress hosting of your choice. The CAWeb theme is a child theme of Divi by [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/).

# Setup
If your organization is moving to WordPress CMS, but you are not subscribing to the CAWeb Publishing Service, you'll need cloud hosting and the State Template child theme. Here are the steps to get started:
1. [Procure AWS hosting](https://cdt.ca.gov/services/staas/) and install WordPress (takes about 5 minutes). We don't recommend on-premise hosting as it is generally more expensivie to procure and maintain. However, if you are determined to host on-prem, here's a good guide from [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-16-04).
2. Purchase a Divi license from [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/join/) and dowload the theme. Divi is the parent theme used with the CAWeb/WordPress State Template child theme. Divi is required.
3. Upload the Divi theme to your new WordPress instance.
4. Download the latest release of the [CAWeb theme](https://github.com/Office-of-Digital-Innovation/CAWeb/releases/). (You must be part the the Office of Digital Innovation Organization on Github). Send email to cawebpublishingservice@state.ca.gov with your Git ID to be added to the ODI Org.
5. Upload the CAWeb theme to your new WordPress instance.
6. Activate the CAWeb theme for you site and refer to [caweb.ca.gov](https://caweb.ca.gov/) for more information.
